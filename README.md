# Blackcoffer-Web-Scraping-and-Text-Analysis

## Overview
This project involves web scraping articles from the Blackcoffer website, performing data cleaning using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and conducting text analysis to extract relevant features. The entire process is implemented in Python, leveraging the requests library for web scraping and the BeautifulSoup library for HTML parsing. NLP techniques, including tokenization and regular expression-based data cleaning, are employed to preprocess the extracted text.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following key components:

Web Scraping:
For extracting articles' text and titles from Blackcoffer web pages, requests library is utilized to make HTTP requests, and BeautifulSoup is employed for parsing HTML content.

Data Cleaning:
NLP techniques such as tokenization and regular expression-based methods are applied to cleanse the extracted texts and titles.

Text Analysis:
This section involves extracting insights from the processed text and deriving meaningful features for further analysis.

In summery, this project focuses on utilizing web scraping libraries to extract data from Blackcoffer websites articles and NLP library to clearn the data in order to make required analysis.
